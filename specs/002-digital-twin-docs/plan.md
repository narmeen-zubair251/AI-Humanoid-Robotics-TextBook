# Implementation Plan: Module 2: The Digital Twin

**Branch**: `002-digital-twin-docs` | **Date**: December 12, 2025 | **Spec**: specs/002-digital-twin-docs/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-digital-twin-docs/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

The primary requirement is to create a structured documentation module, "Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)", broken into four chapters, each focusing on specific concepts related to digital twins, physics simulation, high-fidelity rendering, and sensor simulation. The technical approach involves generating Markdown files that adhere to Docusaurus's documentation structure and best practices for content creation.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Markdown (Docusaurus compatible)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus for rendering and structuring documentation.  
**Storage**: Filesystem for `.md` files.  
**Testing**: Manual review for content accuracy and formatting. Docusaurus `build` and `serve` commands for rendering validation and link checking.  
**Target Platform**: Web (static site generated by Docusaurus).  
**Project Type**: Documentation/Content Generation.  
**Performance Goals**: Fast generation of content, clear and readable rendering of documentation.  
**Constraints**: Adherence to Docusaurus markdown syntax and conventions. Content must be educational and suitable for beginners to intermediate technical readers.
**Scale/Scope**: Four distinct chapters covering specific topics within Module 2, including an introduction, Gazebo physics, Unity rendering, and sensor simulation.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [x] **Spec-Driven Development**: The plan adheres to the predefined specification for Module 2 content.
- [x] **Clarity and Coherence**: The planned content structure and topics prioritize clear and coherent presentation for the target audience.
- [x] **Tooling Alignment**: The plan leverages Docusaurus for documentation generation.
- [x] **Hands-on Learning**: The chapter outlines include concepts that will facilitate practical examples and exercises (e.g., setting up Gazebo world, creating Unity scene, spawning sensors).
- [x] **Testable Content**: Content is designed to be structured for potential automated validation and manual review.
- [x] **Maintainability & Consistency**: The structured approach ensures consistent writing style, formatting, and content within the module.

### Generated Documentation Output (my-book/docs)

```text
my-book/docs/
└── module-02-digital-twin/
    ├── chapter-01-introduction/
    │   └── index.md
    ├── chapter-02-gazebo-physics/

    ├── chapter-03-unity-rendering/
    │   └── index.md
    └── chapter-04-sensor-simulation/
        └── index.md
```

**Structure Decision**: The documentation will be structured into a new `module-02-digital-twin` directory under `my-book/docs`, with subdirectories for each chapter. Each chapter will contain an `index.md` file, which will be the primary content file for that chapter. This aligns with Docusaurus's content organization for multi-page documents.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

The research phase is complete. The `research.md` file outlines the content gathering and structuring tasks for each chapter of Module 2. All content-related "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" points have been implicitly addressed by defining the scope of research for each topic.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

**Prerequisites:** `research.md` complete

In the context of documentation generation, the outputs of Phase 1 are adapted as follows:

1.  **data-model.md**: Will define the content structure and common elements expected within each markdown chapter. This acts as a content style guide and ensures consistency.
2.  **contracts/**: Will document the Docusaurus-specific markdown syntax, directives, and conventions that should be adhered to in the generated chapters.
3.  **quickstart.md**: Will provide a brief guide on how to access and navigate the newly generated "Module 2: The Digital Twin" documentation within the Docusaurus site.
