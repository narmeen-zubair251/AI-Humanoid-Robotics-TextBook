# Quickstart Guide: Module 2: The Digital Twin Documentation

**Feature Branch**: `002-digital-twin-docs` | **Date**: December 12, 2025 | **Spec**: [link to spec.md]

## Introduction

This guide provides a quick overview of how to access and navigate the newly generated "Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)" documentation within the Docusaurus site. This module is designed to introduce foundational concepts and practical applications of digital twins in humanoid robotics.

## Accessing the Documentation

1.  **Start the Docusaurus Development Server**:
    If you are running the Docusaurus project locally, open your terminal in the `my-book/` directory and run:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This will typically open the documentation in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

2.  **Navigate to the Module**:
    Once the Docusaurus site is loaded:
    -   Locate the sidebar navigation on the left-hand side of the page.
    -   Look for a section titled "Module 2: The Digital Twin".
    -   Expand this section to see the list of chapters within the module.

## Module Structure

"Module 2: The Digital Twin" is organized into the following chapters:

-   **Chapter 1: Introduction to Digital Twins**: Explains core concepts, the role of Gazebo and Unity, and the importance of simulation.
-   **Chapter 2: Physics Simulation in Gazebo**: Covers gravity, collisions, joints, and robot movement within Gazebo.
-   **Chapter 3: High-Fidelity Simulation in Unity**: Discusses rendering, environment building, and human-robot interaction in Unity.
-   **Chapter 4: Simulating Sensors**: Details the simulation of LiDAR, Depth Cameras, and IMUs.

## Key Navigation Tips

-   **Sidebar**: Use the sidebar to quickly jump between different chapters and sections within Module 2.
-   **Table of Contents**: Each page includes an on-page table of contents (usually on the right) for quick navigation within that specific chapter.
-   **Search**: Use the search bar (if enabled) to find specific keywords or topics across the entire documentation site.

Enjoy learning about Digital Twins!
