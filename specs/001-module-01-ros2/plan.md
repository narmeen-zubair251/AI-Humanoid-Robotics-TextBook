# Implementation Plan: Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

**Branch**: `001-module-01-ros2` | **Date**: 2025-12-11 | **Spec**: specs/001-module-01-ros2/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/001-module-01-ros2/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

This plan outlines the creation of "Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)" within a Docusaurus-based book. The module will contain four chapters focusing on ROS 2 basics, Python agent integration with `rclpy`, and URDF for humanoid robots, all structured for beginner-friendly, hands-on learning, as per the detailed user request.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.x (for `rclpy` code examples)  
**Primary Dependencies**: ROS 2 (Humble Hawksbill distribution recommended for consistency and stability), `rclpy` library (ROS 2 Python client), Docusaurus (for documentation framework and deployment)  
**Storage**: Markdown files (`.md`) and associated assets within the Docusaurus project structure.  
**Testing**: Manual content review for clarity, accuracy, and beginner-friendliness; Docusaurus build verification to ensure correct rendering and navigation; execution verification of `rclpy` code examples.  
**Target Platform**: Web (static site generated by Docusaurus, deployable on GitHub Pages).  
**Project Type**: Documentation (Book)  
**Performance Goals**: Ensure fast loading times for Docusaurus-generated pages; clear and legible rendering of code blocks and diagrams.  
**Constraints**: Content must adhere strictly to beginner-friendly principles; all chapter content must be in Docusaurus-ready Markdown format; focus on humanoid robots where URDF is discussed; content must align with the structure defined in `spec.md`.  
**Scale/Scope**: The module comprises four distinct chapters, with an estimated content volume of approximately 50-100 pages of comprehensive explanation and examples.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

*   **I. Spec-Driven Development:** ✅ This plan is derived directly from the `specs/001-module-01-ros2/spec.md`, ensuring all content and structural requirements are addressed.
*   **II. Clarity and Coherence:** ✅ The plan emphasizes structured content, clear explanations, and logical flow across chapters to enhance clarity and coherence for the target audience.
*   **III. Tooling Alignment:** ✅ The plan explicitly incorporates Docusaurus for documentation generation and `rclpy` for Python-ROS 2 integration, aligning with the project's mandated tooling.
*   **IV. Hands-on Learning:** ✅ The plan includes dedicated sections for step-by-step code examples in the `rclpy` chapter and practical URDF examples, directly supporting hands-on learning.
*   **V. Testable Content:** ✅ Content will undergo manual review for accuracy and beginner-friendliness, and `rclpy` code examples will be verified for executability and correctness.
*   **VI. Maintainability & Consistency:** ✅ The use of Docusaurus Markdown and a defined chapter structure ensures high maintainability and consistent formatting throughout the module.

## Project Structure

### Documentation (this feature)

```text
my-book/
└── docs/
    └── module-01-ros2/
        ├── chapter-01-introduction/
        │   └── index.md
        ├── chapter-02-ros2-basics/
        │   └── index.md

```

### Source Code (repository root)

```text
# No direct source code changes at the repository root are anticipated for this feature,
# as it primarily involves documentation content creation.
```

**Structure Decision**: The chosen structure directly mirrors the requirements from `spec.md`, organizing content into a logical module within the `my-book/docs` path, with each chapter residing in its own subdirectory containing an `index.md` file.

## Complexity Tracking

N/A - This feature involves content creation and organization within an existing documentation framework, not complex software development that typically incurs significant complexity violations or unique technical debt requiring dedicated tracking. The principles of clarity and structure mitigate inherent content complexity.
