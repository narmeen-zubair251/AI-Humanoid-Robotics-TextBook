# Tasks Quality Checklist: Homepage UI

**Purpose**: Validate task completeness and quality before implementation
**Created**: 2025-12-29
**Feature**: [Link to tasks.md]

## Content Quality

- [x] All tasks follow the required checklist format (checkbox, ID, labels, file paths)
- [x] Tasks are organized by user story for independent implementation
- [x] All mandatory sections completed
- [x] Task descriptions are specific and actionable

## Task Organization

- [x] Tasks organized in proper phase structure (Setup → Foundational → User Stories → Polish)
- [x] User story tasks have proper [US1], [US2], [US3] labels
- [x] Parallelizable tasks marked with [P] label
- [x] Dependencies clearly identified between phases
- [x] Independent test criteria defined for each user story

## Implementation Feasibility

- [x] All tasks are achievable with current technology
- [x] File paths are accurate and specific
- [x] Task sequence follows logical implementation order
- [x] Critical setup tasks identified in Phase 1
- [x] Blocking prerequisites in Phase 2 before user stories

## Task Quality

- [x] Each task has a clear file path
- [x] Task IDs are sequential (T001, T002, etc.)
- [x] All user story tasks have proper story labels
- [x] Setup and foundational tasks have no story labels
- [x] Polish phase tasks have no story labels
- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain

## Feature Readiness

- [x] Tasks cover all functional requirements from spec
- [x] All user stories from spec have corresponding tasks
- [x] Success criteria from spec are addressed by implementation tasks
- [x] Implementation approach maintains Docusaurus compatibility
- [x] Tasks ensure no documentation content is modified

## Notes

- All validation items have passed
- Tasks are ready for implementation phase
- Each task is specific enough for an LLM to complete without additional context
